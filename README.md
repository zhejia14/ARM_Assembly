# ðŸ§  Assembly Language Projects

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the *Assembly Language* course at **National Chung Cheng University**. The projects focus on low-level programming using **ARM assembly**, offering hands-on experience with core concepts such as arithmetic operations, memory manipulation, and performance optimization.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Descriptions

1. **Arithmetic Operations in ARM Assembly**  
   Implement basic arithmetic operations using ARM assembly instructions.

2. **Matrix Computation in ARM Assembly**  
   Perform matrix-related computations using nested loops and memory addressing in ARM assembly.

3. **NumSort â€“ Basic Sorting Function**  
   Write a function called `NumSort` that sorts an integer array in ascending order.

4. **NumSort + Array Printing**  
   Extend `NumSort` to print the sorted array to the output.

5. **NumSort + Array Output to File**  
   Modify `NumSort` to write the sorted array to an output file.

6. **SIMD-based Arithmetic with Intrinsic Functions**  
   Use **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** intrinsic functions to perform high-performance vectorized calculations.
